Based on the provided method `process`, here are the test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Test the process method with a valid sample input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_valid_sample
  Description: This test verifies that the process method correctly calculates the output y[n] when given a valid sample input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of a class that implements the FilterType protocol.
  Act: Call the process method with a valid sample input.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected output based on the filter's specifications.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the process method correctly applies the filter's logic to the input sample and produces the expected output. It validates the core functionality of the filter.

Scenario 2: Test the process method with a sample input of zero
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_zero_sample
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the process method when the input sample is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of a class that implements the FilterType protocol.
  Act: Call the process method with a sample input of zero.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected output based on the filter's specifications for a zero input.
Validation:
  Testing with a zero input sample helps to ensure that the filter handles this special case correctly and produces the expected output. It validates the filter's behavior for a boundary condition.

Scenario 3: Test the process method with a large positive sample input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_positive_sample
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the process method when the input sample is a large positive value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of a class that implements the FilterType protocol.
  Act: Call the process method with a large positive sample input.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected output based on the filter's specifications for a large positive input.
Validation:
  Testing with a large positive sample input helps to ensure that the filter can handle extreme values correctly and produces the expected output. It validates the filter's behavior for an edge case.

Scenario 4: Test the process method with a large negative sample input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_large_negative_sample
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the process method when the input sample is a large negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of a class that implements the FilterType protocol.
  Act: Call the process method with a large negative sample input.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected output based on the filter's specifications for a large negative input.
Validation:
  Testing with a large negative sample input helps to ensure that the filter can handle extreme values correctly and produces the expected output. It validates the filter's behavior for an edge case.

Scenario 5: Test the process method with a sample input that triggers a specific condition
Details:
  TestName: test_process_with_specific_condition
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the process method when the input sample triggers a specific condition within the filter's logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of a class that implements the FilterType protocol.
  Act: Call the process method with a sample input that triggers the specific condition.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected output based on the filter's specifications for the specific condition.
Validation:
  Testing with a sample input that triggers a specific condition helps to ensure that the filter handles that condition correctly and produces the expected output. It validates the filter's behavior for a specific scenario.

These test scenarios cover different aspects of the `process` method's behavior, including valid inputs, boundary conditions, edge cases, and specific conditions within the filter's logic. They help ensure that the filter functions correctly according to its specifications and business requirements.
