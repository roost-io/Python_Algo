ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=make_bandpass_e90e9eadc4

Here are the pytest test scenarios for the provided make_bandpass method:

Scenario 1: Valid input parameters produce expected filter coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_valid_input
  Description: This test verifies that the make_bandpass function generates the correct filter coefficients when provided with valid input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_bandpass with valid frequency, samplerate, and q_factor values.
  Assert: Compare the generated filter coefficients (a_coeffs and b_coeffs) against the expected values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_bandpass function correctly calculates and sets the filter coefficients based on the provided input parameters, which is essential for creating a functional band-pass filter.

Scenario 2: Default q_factor value is used when not provided
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_default_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the make_bandpass function uses the default q_factor value (1 / sqrt(2)) when no q_factor is explicitly provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_bandpass with valid frequency and samplerate values, omitting the q_factor parameter.
  Assert: Compare the generated filter coefficients (a_coeffs and b_coeffs) against the expected values calculated using the default q_factor.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_bandpass function correctly handles the case when the q_factor is not provided, using the default value as specified in the function signature.

Scenario 3: Extreme frequency and samplerate values produce expected filter coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_extreme_values
  Description: This test verifies that the make_bandpass function generates the correct filter coefficients even when provided with extreme frequency and samplerate values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_bandpass with extreme frequency and samplerate values (e.g., very low or very high values).
  Assert: Compare the generated filter coefficients (a_coeffs and b_coeffs) against the expected values calculated using the provided extreme values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_bandpass function remains numerically stable and produces accurate filter coefficients even when dealing with extreme input values, demonstrating its robustness.

Scenario 4: Very small or very large q_factor values produce expected filter coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_extreme_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the make_bandpass function generates the correct filter coefficients when provided with very small or very large q_factor values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_bandpass with valid frequency and samplerate values, and provide very small or very large q_factor values.
  Assert: Compare the generated filter coefficients (a_coeffs and b_coeffs) against the expected values calculated using the provided q_factor values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_bandpass function correctly handles extreme q_factor values and produces accurate filter coefficients, demonstrating its stability and correctness across a wide range of q_factor inputs.

Scenario 5: Returned IIRFilter object has the expected order
Details:
  TestName: test_make_bandpass_filter_order
  Description: This test verifies that the make_bandpass function returns an IIRFilter object with the expected order (2).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_bandpass with valid input parameters and store the returned IIRFilter object.
  Assert: Check that the order attribute of the returned IIRFilter object is equal to 2.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_bandpass function correctly initializes and returns an IIRFilter object with the specified order, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the band-pass filter.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the make_bandpass function, including its behavior with valid inputs, default values, extreme values, and the correctness of the returned IIRFilter object. They help ensure that the function performs as expected and produces accurate filter coefficients under different conditions.
