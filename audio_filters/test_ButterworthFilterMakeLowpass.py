ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=make_lowpass_c429b6062d

Here are the pytest test scenarios for the provided make_lowpass function:

Scenario 1: Valid Low-Pass Filter Creation
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_lowpass_filter_creation
  Description: This test verifies that the make_lowpass function correctly creates a low-pass filter with the specified frequency and sample rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_lowpass with valid frequency and sample rate values.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure that the make_lowpass function correctly calculates and sets the filter coefficients based on the provided frequency and sample rate. It validates the core functionality of creating a low-pass filter.

Scenario 2: Default Q-Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_default_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the make_lowpass function uses the default Q-factor value of 1/sqrt(2) when not explicitly provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_lowpass with valid frequency and sample rate values, omitting the q_factor parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected coefficients, assuming the default Q-factor value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_lowpass function correctly handles the case when the Q-factor is not explicitly provided and uses the default value. It validates the expected behavior and maintains consistency with the function's specification.

Scenario 3: Custom Q-Factor
Details:
  TestName: test_custom_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the make_lowpass function correctly creates a low-pass filter with a custom Q-factor value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_lowpass with valid frequency, sample rate, and a custom Q-factor value.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected coefficients based on the provided Q-factor.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_lowpass function correctly incorporates the custom Q-factor value into the filter coefficient calculations. It validates the flexibility and correctness of the function when a specific Q-factor is provided.

Scenario 4: Frequency Exceeds Nyquist Limit
Details:
  TestName: test_frequency_exceeds_nyquist_limit
  Description: This test verifies that the make_lowpass function handles the case when the provided frequency exceeds the Nyquist frequency (half the sample rate).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_lowpass with a frequency value greater than half the sample rate.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate exception or returns an IIRFilter object with expected coefficients for the Nyquist frequency.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_lowpass function properly handles the case when the provided frequency is beyond the valid range. It validates that the function either raises an exception or adjusts the frequency to the Nyquist limit to prevent aliasing and maintain the integrity of the filter.

Scenario 5: Zero Frequency
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_frequency
  Description: This test verifies that the make_lowpass function handles the case when the provided frequency is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call make_lowpass with a frequency value of zero.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate exception or returns an IIRFilter object with expected coefficients for a very low frequency.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_lowpass function properly handles the case when the provided frequency is zero. It validates that the function either raises an exception or adjusts the frequency to a very low value to prevent division by zero and maintain the stability of the filter.

These test scenarios cover the core functionality, default behavior, custom Q-factor handling, and edge cases related to frequency values. They ensure that the make_lowpass function correctly creates low-pass filters based on the provided parameters and handles exceptional cases appropriately.
