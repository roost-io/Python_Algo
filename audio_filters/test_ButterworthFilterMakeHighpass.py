ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=make_highpass_82938f5d7d

Here are the pytest test scenarios for the provided make_highpass function:

Scenario 1: Valid input parameters
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_with_valid_input
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highpass function creates a valid IIRFilter object when provided with valid input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare valid input parameters for frequency, samplerate, and q_factor.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared input parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned object is an instance of IIRFilter and has the expected number of coefficients.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_highpass function correctly creates an IIRFilter object with the specified input parameters, validating the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Default q_factor value
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_with_default_q_factor
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highpass function uses the default value of q_factor (1 / sqrt(2)) when not explicitly provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare valid input parameters for frequency and samplerate.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared input parameters, omitting the q_factor parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected coefficients, calculated using the default q_factor value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_highpass function correctly handles the case when q_factor is not provided, using the default value specified in the function signature.

Scenario 3: Extreme frequency values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_with_extreme_frequency_values
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highpass function creates a valid IIRFilter object when provided with extreme frequency values (e.g., very low or very high frequencies).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input parameters with extreme frequency values, along with valid samplerate and q_factor.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared input parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected coefficients, calculated using the provided extreme frequency values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_highpass function correctly handles extreme frequency values and produces a valid IIRFilter object without any numerical instability or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 4: Extreme q_factor values
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_with_extreme_q_factor_values
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highpass function creates a valid IIRFilter object when provided with extreme q_factor values (e.g., very low or very high values).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input parameters with valid frequency and samplerate, along with extreme q_factor values.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared input parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned IIRFilter object has the expected coefficients, calculated using the provided extreme q_factor values.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_highpass function correctly handles extreme q_factor values and produces a valid IIRFilter object without any numerical instability or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 5: Coefficient calculation accuracy
Details:
  TestName: test_make_highpass_coefficient_calculation_accuracy
  Description: This test verifies that the make_highpass function calculates the filter coefficients accurately, based on the provided input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input parameters with known frequency, samplerate, and q_factor values.
  Act: Call the make_highpass function with the prepared input parameters.
  Assert: Compare the calculated coefficients of the returned IIRFilter object with the expected coefficients, ensuring they match within a specified tolerance.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the make_highpass function correctly implements the mathematical calculations for determining the filter coefficients, providing confidence in the accuracy of the generated high-pass filter.

These test scenarios cover the essential aspects of the make_highpass function, including valid input handling, default parameter values, extreme input values, and the accuracy of the coefficient calculations. They aim to validate the business logic encapsulated by the function and ensure its correct behavior under various conditions.
