Here are the test scenarios for the provided `set_coefficients` method:

```
Scenario 1: Setting valid coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_set_valid_coefficients
  Description: Verify that the method correctly sets the coefficients when provided with valid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a specific order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with valid a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists of the correct length.
  Assert: Check that the a_coeffs and b_coeffs attributes of the IIRFilter instance are set correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method behaves as expected when provided with valid input, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the IIR filter.

Scenario 2: Setting coefficients with missing a_0
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_missing_a_0
  Description: Verify that the method correctly handles the case when a_0 is missing from the a_coeffs list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a specific order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with a_coeffs list missing the first element (a_0) and a valid b_coeffs list.
  Assert: Check that the a_coeffs attribute of the IIRFilter instance is set correctly, with 1.0 as the first element.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method properly handles the case when a_0 is missing, using the default value of 1.0, as per the method's documentation.

Scenario 3: Setting coefficients with incorrect a_coeffs length
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_incorrect_a_coeffs_length
  Description: Verify that the method raises a ValueError when the length of a_coeffs does not match the expected length based on the filter order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a specific order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with an a_coeffs list of incorrect length and a valid b_coeffs list.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method validates the length of the a_coeffs list and raises an error when it does not match the expected length, preventing the use of invalid coefficients.

Scenario 4: Setting coefficients with incorrect b_coeffs length
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_incorrect_b_coeffs_length
  Description: Verify that the method raises a ValueError when the length of b_coeffs does not match the expected length based on the filter order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a specific order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with a valid a_coeffs list and a b_coeffs list of incorrect length.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised with the appropriate error message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method validates the length of the b_coeffs list and raises an error when it does not match the expected length, preventing the use of invalid coefficients.

Scenario 5: Setting coefficients with both a_coeffs and b_coeffs of incorrect length
Details:
  TestName: test_set_coefficients_both_coeffs_incorrect_length
  Description: Verify that the method raises a ValueError when both a_coeffs and b_coeffs have incorrect lengths.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the IIRFilter class with a specific order.
  Act: Call the set_coefficients method with both a_coeffs and b_coeffs lists of incorrect lengths.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised, and the error message corresponds to the a_coeffs length mismatch.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method correctly prioritizes the validation of a_coeffs length over b_coeffs length when both are incorrect, providing a clear and accurate error message.
```

These scenarios cover the main aspects of the `set_coefficients` method's business logic, including setting valid coefficients, handling missing a_0, and validating the lengths of the coefficient lists. They help ensure the method behaves as expected and raises appropriate errors when provided with invalid input.
