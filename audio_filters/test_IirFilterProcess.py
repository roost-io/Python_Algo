Here are the test scenarios for the provided `process` method:

Scenario 1: Process a single sample with default filter coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_process_single_sample_default_coefficients
  Description: This test verifies that the `process` method correctly calculates the output for a single input sample using the default filter coefficients.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `IIRFilter` class with a specified order (e.g., 2).
  Act: Call the `process` method with a single input sample (e.g., 1.0).
  Assert: Check that the returned output matches the expected value based on the default filter coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `process` method correctly applies the filter coefficients and calculates the output for a single input sample. It validates the basic functionality of the filter.

Scenario 2: Process multiple samples sequentially
Details:
  TestName: test_process_multiple_samples_sequentially
  Description: This test verifies that the `process` method correctly handles multiple input samples processed sequentially, maintaining the correct state of input and output histories.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `IIRFilter` class with a specified order (e.g., 2).
  Act: Call the `process` method multiple times with different input samples.
  Assert: Check that the returned outputs match the expected values based on the filter coefficients and the input samples.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to validate that the `process` method correctly updates the input and output histories and calculates the output for each input sample in a sequence. It ensures the filter maintains the correct state across multiple invocations.

Scenario 3: Process samples with custom filter coefficients
Details:
  TestName: test_process_samples_custom_coefficients
  Description: This test verifies that the `process` method correctly calculates the output when custom filter coefficients are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `IIRFilter` class with a specified order (e.g., 2) and set custom filter coefficients.
  Act: Call the `process` method with one or more input samples.
  Assert: Check that the returned outputs match the expected values based on the custom filter coefficients.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `process` method correctly applies custom filter coefficients provided by the user. It validates the flexibility of the filter to work with different coefficient sets.

Scenario 4: Process samples with zero input
Details:
  TestName: test_process_samples_zero_input
  Description: This test verifies that the `process` method correctly handles zero input samples and returns the expected output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `IIRFilter` class with a specified order (e.g., 2).
  Act: Call the `process` method with a zero input sample.
  Assert: Check that the returned output matches the expected value based on the filter coefficients and zero input.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `process` method correctly handles zero input samples and does not introduce any unexpected behavior or errors.

Scenario 5: Process samples with large input values
Details:
  TestName: test_process_samples_large_input
  Description: This test verifies that the `process` method correctly handles large input sample values and returns the expected output without any precision or overflow issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the `IIRFilter` class with a specified order (e.g., 2).
  Act: Call the `process` method with a large input sample value.
  Assert: Check that the returned output matches the expected value based on the filter coefficients and the large input value.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the `process` method can handle large input values without any numerical instability or overflow issues. It validates the robustness of the filter implementation.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `process` method, including default and custom filter coefficients, sequential processing of samples, handling of zero input, and large input values. They aim to validate the correctness and robustness of the filter implementation based on the provided business logic and requirements.
